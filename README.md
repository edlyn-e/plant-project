## Shibui: E-commerce Website

### Outline

This goal of this project is to reinforce and further develop my skills and understanding of React. The aim is to create an e-commerce website using the following:

-   Fetch data with React
-   React-router-dom
-   Firebase/Firestore

### Criteria

A minimum of three pages:

-   Home Page
    -   Product grid
    -   Carousel of featured products
-   Product page where
    -   add the item to cart
    -   select product variants

All products should be stored in Firestore:

-   Product Info
    -   Quantity
    -   Variants (size, colors, styles etc.)
    -   Price per unit
    -   Name
    -   Image URL
    -   Saved items

All data should be stored in Firestore and fetched by frontend.
There should be NO static product data

The third page: Create a cart system using Firestore and React.

-   Cart page in React application
    -   prevent users from adding items that are no longer in stock

In the cart page:

-   List of items in cart
-   Add/Remove items from cart
-   Edit quantity
    -   Example: Customer wants 10 items, instead of clicking " + " 10x, input/select to be able to add 10 items at once
